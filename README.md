**Test objective**

The objective of this test is to create an HTML page with a calendar reflecting the data
on the provided JSON.

**Requisites**

Every day must start at 09:00 and end at 18:00 leaving the unfilled hours in blank.

Each class has a 1 hour duration unless there's another class after it, then it is as long
as needed in order to fill the space until the next class.

It should be writen on PHP5 or major(including 7) and have unit testing.

It should also respect OOP and Solid principles.

Bonus points for using Docker and having integration tests.
